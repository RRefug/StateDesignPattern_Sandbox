# State Design Pattern Deeper Dive Exploration

Intrigued with clean code, refactoring, system design, and code architecture. I remembered design patterns and was hoping to use some in an ongoing project. Eager to deepen my understanding, I started exploring the **State Design Pattern** through a small work-in-progress project.

I used online resources to guide my initial outline and built the project based on pseudocode examples. Along the way, I improved my ability to read UML class diagrams and interpret relationships like aggregation and association — skills that will definitely help me implement other patterns in future projects, including my ongoing **Alien Invasion** refactor.

This repo is a sandbox for experimenting with architectural ideas. Right now, I'm tackling a circular import issue and working toward a cleaner package structure using `__init__.py` files to expose interfaces.

Stay tuned—this project is evolving as I learn.




- Understand and implement the State Design Pattern
- Practice reading and applying UML diagrams
- Explore package structure and import management in Python
- Apply lessons learned to larger projects like Alien Invasion
